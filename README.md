# Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program
The goal of this project is to classify different traffic signs by training deep neural networks

Overview

In this project, you will use what you've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. You will train and validate a model so it can classify traffic sign images using the German Traffic Sign Dataset. After the model is trained, you will then try out your model on images of German traffic signs that you find on the web.

I have included an Ipython notebook that contains the code. 

A detailed writeup of the project is given in the writeup file. 

This project has three main files:

The Ipython notebook with the code
The code exported as an html file
A writeup report 

The Project:
The goals / steps of this project are the following:

Load the data set

Explore, summarize and visualize the data set

Design, train and test a model architecture

Use the model to make predictions on new images

Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images

Summarize the results with a written report

Dependencies
This lab requires: CarND Term1 Starter Kit - link - https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit

Dataset and Repository
Download the data set here - https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/traffic-signs-data.zip. 
This is a pickled dataset in which the images are resized to 32x32. It contains a training, validation and test set.
